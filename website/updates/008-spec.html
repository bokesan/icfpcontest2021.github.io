  The Lightning Division (first 24 hours of the contest) has now ended.  We
  hope everyone had fun so far!

<p>
  We have now extended <a href="specification.html">the specification</a> with
  <em>bonuses</em>, which allow you gain certain advantages in other problems.
</p>
<p>
  We have also added 10 new problems to
  <a href="https://poses.live/">poses.live</a>.

  The scoreboard will remain frozen for another half hour, until 12:30 UTC.
