  We have set up a Discord server for participants to communicate and
  socialise during the contest.

  Please note that we use the
  <a href="https://berlincodeofconduct.org/">Berlin Code of Conduct</a>.
  This website remains the single source of truth for the contest and all
  announcements will be posted here.
