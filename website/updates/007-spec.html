New problems added, HTTP API addition
2021-07-10 00:00:00+00:00
<p>
  We have added 19 new problems to <a href="https://poses.live/">poses.live</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We would like to remind everyone that the Lightning Division ends in twelve
  hours on Sat, 10 July 12:00 (noon) UTC.
</p>
<p>
  To keep things exciting, we will freeze the scoreboard temporarily on
  Sat, 10 July from 11:30 to 12:30 UTC.  We've also limited the scoreboard to
  teams with at least one valid solution.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, we have updated <a href="specification.html">the
  specification</a> with a new API endpoint to obtain some information about
  submitted poses.
